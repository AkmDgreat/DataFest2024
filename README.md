# DataFest2024
The project was created for the ASA DataFest 2024 (A Datathon)

My team analyzed the data of an education company (CourseKata) and suggested ways to improve the course content/structure to increase student learning.

We plotted histrograms to compare the student learning with lessons with and without the video, and found no significant impact of videos on student learning
